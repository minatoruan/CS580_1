The repository contains only two significant Hadoop projects and a simulator of distributed computing. 
- CaliRoadMap: The project demonstrates the implementation of finding a shorted paths with Dijstra algorithm. 
- LastFM: The project demonstrates the  implementation of simple analytic jobs on LastFM dataset.
- Distributed simulators: a series of implementation of a dictionary application. The implementation is improved from single access to remote access using udp, rpc protocols. The two lastest models are the sort of a distributed system implemented with multithreading for demonstrating two  model workers: parallel and concurrent at server side.
